-	$D: Whatcha doin’? (Giọng Isabella trong P&F).<br><br> 
-	$M: Hi. I’m just reading a book about forensics. I really admire the way this science can unlock the mysteries of the past. For murderers, there’s no hiding place ‘coz even the faintest of human traces can leave a message. <br><br>
-	$D: Amazing! But it takes quite much time to study those stuff as well. Now I’m fascinated to learn more about the use of technology in policing. It is also being exploited by the criminals with more sophisticated modus operandi. <br><br>
-	$M:  I think professional knowledge and physical strength are the key to successful handling of any kinds of crimes. <br><br>
-	$D: I don’t think so. Without updates of crimes in the age of technology, we could barely stay ahead of criminals and accomplish all the assigned missions.($H và P đi ra)<br><br>
-	%P: Hey guys,  look at this! Can’t believe we’re having Virtual Reality right here in this academy. This is for our class’ experience of a criminal case. Do you wanna try? <br><br>
-	$D:  Virtual? And Reality at the same time? You make me so curious!<br><br>
-	$H: Unluckily, there’s only 1 device.<br><br>
-	$M: Let me try first. You can watch my journey via this screen.<br><br>
-	$D: Alright. <br><br>
-	$H: Wear this glass and let the game begin.<br><br>

    $M: Wow this looks so real.<br><br>
    <!-- $$H: You need to complete 2 missions to gain the victory. Are you ready?<br><br>

    $M (thông qua bộ đàm): I am reporting two drug dealer suspects in a slum at 99 Tran Phu Street. Two white males, approximately 20-25 years old, sitting in the corner of the building. Please dispatch a backup unit to assist me. Over.<br><br>
    Hậu cần: On my way. Over!<br><br>
    
    -	$H: I'm your commander. We need more detail to locate them.<br><br> 
    -	$M: I think I should get inside to get more details about the building’s structure and the possible accomplices to carry out the plan. <br><br>
    -	$H: Request denied. These men are armed and dangerous, and should not be approached. <br><br>
    -	$M: What should we do now?<br><br>
    -	$H: You need to deploy some supporting tool. Take one from these.<br><br>
    -	$M (chọn con robot): Is it really helpful? (Hoài nghi về con robot)<br><br>
    -	%P: I'm our team’s technician. This is The Recon Robotics Throw bot XT. It can be used to secretly collect information of the target’s location and break into the building’s corner which can’t be accessed by human and transmit images to this tablet. (vừa nói vừa điều khiển robot đi trinh sát bên kia đối tượng)<br><br>
    -	$M: Such a powerful gadget! Can’t believe this small thing can do that. (Cầm tablet và nhìn thấy vị trí đối tượng trong Map). Oh I see! They’re on the second floor.<br><br>

    -	$D: How was the trip?<br><br>
    $M:  To me it’s a real eye-opener!   It can provide police forces with enhanced situational awareness in such surveillance operations.<br><br>

    -	N: That's what our academy expects us to realize through this simulation - The role of a security officer in the 4th industrial revoluntion battle.<br><br>
    -	%P: Therefore, As a young cadet, we must  maintain not only our political integrity and professional knowledge, but we must also improve our scientific and technological skills, and innovate them in the fight against all kinds of criminals.<br><br>
    -	$M: We should convey this message to other cadets not only in PSA but also in MPS in general.<br><br>
