    Diệp: What’cha doin’? (Giọng Isabella trong P&F).<br><br> 
    M: Hi. I’m just reading book.<br><br> 
    D: I’ve just read some news about a kind of high-tech crime. <br><br>
    M: Wdym?<br><br>
    D: It means that they’re exploiting technology as a sophisticated method to violate users’ privacy and even national security. For example: from online drug trafficking, cyber theft to cyber espionage. <br><br>
    M: Sounds interesting but I think that we only need expertise and strength to deal with all kinds of criminals. <br><br>
    D: I don’t think so. We, as security officers, have to enhance our technological knowledge and skills to complete all given missions. <br><br>
    (H và P đi ra)<br><br>
    P: Hey guys, I see that you guys are having some problems there. Our academy is experimenting with VR technology for students' studies. Do you wanna try? Maybe you can find the answer. <br><br>

    H: I'm your commanders. We need more detail to catch them<br><br>
    M: I think I should get inside to get more details about the structure of the building and their accomplices to carry out the plan. <br><br>
    H: Request denied. The building is too big with many obstacles. It will take a lot of time and be dangerous for you to do so. <br><br>
    M: What should we do now?<br><br>
    H: We have prepared some equipment. You can choose one. <br><br>
    M (chọn con robot): Is it really helpful? (Hoài nghi về con robot)<br><br>
    P: I'm our team technician. This is The Recon Robotics Throw bot XT. It can be used to secretly collect information about target’s location and break into the building’s corner which can’t be accessed by human and transmit images to this tablet and then we can carry out the arrest.
